Hi, I'm Maksym — Junior Full-Stack Developer

Focus: React / Next.js, Node.js (TypeScript)
Values: accountability, meeting deadlines, creativity

About me

I follow clear professional principles and stay results-oriented. I’m not the one to say “I don’t want to” or “I can’t”—I look for options and drive tasks to release. I take initiative on project improvements: proposing and implementing UX/UI, performance, and accessibility enhancements, and reducing technical debt.

Current goal: deepen my knowledge and skills in React/Next.js and Node.js (TypeScript), shipping small features end-to-end: plan → implement → test → docs.

Tech stack

Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS, SCSS
Backend: Node.js, Express, REST APIs, JWT/OAuth
DB: MongoDB (Mongoose)
Quality & DX: ESLint/Prettier, Jest/RTL, GitHub Actions, Docker (basic)

Selected projects

TravelTrucks (pet project, solo) — responsive camper-rental web app: catalog, filters, favorites, detailed pages; focus on performance (LCP) & SEO
Live: https://travel-trucks-eta-eight.vercel.app/

Stork (Team Leader; Backend) — pregnancy-tracking REST API for the app: JWT auth, user profiles, tracking endpoints, Swagger UI & ReDoc
Live docs: https://nodejs-stork.onrender.com/api-docs

What I'm looking for
